🌾 Rice Crop Disease Prediction & Fertilizer Recommendation System

Python, PyTorch, Contrastive Learning, OpenCV, Roboflow, Deep Learning

Developed a deep learning system to detect rice crop diseases using contrastive learning on leaf images.

Integrated image classification with fertilizer recommendation logic based on disease type.

Preprocessed and augmented datasets using Roboflow, and visualized model performance using Matplotlib.

Achieved high accuracy in disease prediction using PyTorch-based models.


✅ Task Management System using Linked Lists

C++, Data Structures, OOP

Implemented a console-based task manager using singly and doubly linked lists.

Enabled dynamic task addition, deletion, and categorization using DSA concepts.

Applied object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity and code reusability.


✅ Loan Management System (Full Stack Web App)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js

Created a full-stack web application for managing loan records with CRUD functionality.

Designed interactive UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and implemented backend using Express.js.

Utilized MongoDB for storing user and loan data, with form validation and real-time updates.


✅ Course Management System

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js

Developed a responsive web interface to manage student course registrations.

Enabled data storage and retrieval with MongoDB for persistent course and student records.

Focused on a clean frontend using HTML/CSS and dynamic form handling with JavaScript and implemented backend using Express.js.

🖥 Multitasking Operating System Simulation with Paging

C, Operating Systems, Paging, Memory Management, Process Scheduling

Built a simulation of a multitasking operating system in C to manage tasks like downloading, gaming, and media playback, each with defined priorities.
Implemented paging-based memory management to allocate memory dynamically for each process.
Simulated a job scheduler with priority-based execution, ensuring high-priority tasks were completed before lower-priority ones.
Displayed updated memory state after each job execution to visualize page allocation, page table handling, and task switching.
Reinforced core OS concepts such as process lifecycle, page replacement, and memory protection.
